## Overview of Project
We gathered data from Citibikes which is the nation’s largest bike share program. The program is based in New York City and shows that they have 25k bikes and over 1500 stations across New York City. Stakeholder’s have requested that we analyze the data provided by Citibike to show if it makes sense to start a similar program in Des Moines, Iowa. We have analyzed the data for trends. We have created visualizations that show locations, trips, gender breakdown, customer type. Stakeholders in the project have requested additional analysis to show the length of time that bikes are checked out, the number of trips by gender hourly for each week, and the total number of trips by usertype and gender for each day of the week. All the visualizations were created using tableau and have been published and can be accessed using the following link:

## Results

### Main Dashboard 

![Dashboard](https://github.com/john10roberts/bikesharing/blob/main/Resources/Dashboard.png)

This dashboard shows the user the top starting and ending locations, gender breakdown, total trips and usertype. Men are the biggest users of citibikes and are the largest percentage of subscribers. 35 East 38th street seems to be the biggest starting and ending location. 

### Checkout Times

![Checkout Times](https://github.com/john10roberts/bikesharing/blob/main/Resources/CheckoutTimes.png)

This visualization shows that most bike trips take around 5 minutes. Sharp increases up to 5 min then sharp declines as trip durations increase up to 2 hours and 59 minutes. 

### Checkout Times by Gender

This visualization accompanies the previous and breaks down the trip durations men as the largest users make up most of the 5-minute trips.  Women have a slightly higher peak trip duration at 6 mins. Other's shows a lower average duration. 

### Trips by Gender

![Trips by Gender by Day](https://github.com/john10roberts/bikesharing/blob/main/Resources/CheckoutTimesGenderWeekday.png)

This visualization shows that Thursdays at 6 PM are the highest usage times of bikes for both men and women.  Unknown gender usage shows heavier on Saturdays and Sundays

### Trips by Customer Type and Gender

This visualization shows that Thursdays are the biggest usage days for both men and women subscribers. 

## Summary 
While this information shows that Citibikes seems to be a great fit for a city such as New York, further analysis should be performed to see if Des Moines would be a suitable location for a bike sharing program. 

One of the first things that should be considered would be the general demographics of Des Moines. Does it align favorably with New York. A visualization should be provided to show average ages, number of drivers vs the number of people who walk. This visualization should also include comparisons of overall health between the two cities.   If the demographics match up favorably then I think that an analysis should be done to determine if the number of locations in Des Moines would allow for most trips to be within that 5-to-6-minute peak demonstrated in the visualizations.  

Another analysis should be performed to see if the weather in Des Moines is comparable to NYC. A visualization showing average temperatures, precipitation amounts, and types should be provided to show investors if the weather is comparable. 

Once this additional information has been analyzed if everything matches up a bikesharing program could be a viable business for Des Moines.
